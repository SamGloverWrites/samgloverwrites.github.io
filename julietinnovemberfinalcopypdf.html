        >fine sieved rain beats like something hot melted and vitreous, melding
        with the window pane. november, when folks remember they have breath in
        them. the soft rattle of water smatters on the glass, streams forming in
        pools and chipping at the rot where the paint&#39;s been washed away.
        inside, there is the damp, somehow comforting odor of winter moulder, a
        house gradually dying by bedside, and wakefulness drifts down through
        the glaze, whilst Jools flips over in bed, cool back toasting in the
        residual belly heat. Jools doesn&#39;t pay heating, and wisps of clear
        vapour rise and extinguish, fluttering by the headboards, tumbling over
        thin coverlets (doubled up) and the porcupine punctures of feather stems
        which torment sleep. the feline stretch of one&#39;s first morning yawn,
        the one which carries on till after-noon. his arm is numb under the
        pillow, and the weight of his head. pinch, get some blood running.

        morning routine &ndash; the coffee, press-ups, beaten eggs and so on. to
        accommodate a break, or brief divergence would corrupt its order. it can
        persist only so long as it goes unquestioned. its futility must be
        accepted, as one does first death &ndash; one knows reasonably that no
        one is responsible. though one senses, somehow, that reason is a
        gorgeous lie. Jools hoists up to something like a full lotus, cries
        &ldquo;juliet&rdquo;, whilst dimly recalling making fool last evening -
        with some uncertainty. events emerge blurrily, dissipating just as soon,
        like headlights in the fog. blackness, the texture of the pavement, the
        slip of suds on the bar floor - the tabletop, lacquered in spilt, dried
        up beer, a thick glue-like glaze on that one corner, consistently missed
        with every evening wipe down. Jools, you know (how do you do) has no
        headache (rarely does) just hunger &ndash; not for bite, but that
        strange full bellied hunger for wellness, an empty phantom yearning one
        notes when afflicted. the craving itself is difficult to explain;

        washing. Jools&#39; mornings, commonly hungover, are &ldquo;deeply

        out and in between have heard him muse, in a husk gently wan, with

        clumps linen in his hand, draws in breath. exhales the camel smoke of
        what little water remains. Jools is a music critic, which you ought to
        know. he understands the fatalism of spending one&#39;s life speaking of
        poetry, trying to speak with it, without ever actually knowing what it
        means. and worst of all, being somewhat successful as a result &ndash;

        reaches the bathroom sink, ambling through narrow angular, dr caligari

        passed through some kind of tear in reality, slid inside one of those
        mobile black holes from old acme cartoons. he pours out the eggs, stirs,
        and the mass quickly collects as Jools remembers, not simply the
        textures of the evening, but fibres of linked arms stretching, breaking

        smoke, someone&#39;s particular face &ndash; take the eggs off the heat.

        butter, and the coffee on the heat. Jools hums some prosaic tune,

        with an unlocatable nick at the base, which slowly drains the contents
        unless it&#39;s drunk quickly. Jools always drinks his coffee boiling
        &ndash; saves tasting the eggs. and that&#39;s the only mug, retained
        not out of inpecunity but to preserve the contact-less flagellation (of
        the routine). he looks at the eggs in the pan, and thinks of muscular,
        maternal arms flipping omelettes, and virile noses wrinkling with the
        steam and laughing at something, not sure from where the thought arose.
        still hums the same line, repeats the kind of pop guitar phrase he once
        referred to as candified cancer - one cannot be expected to remember the
        entirety of a song, not &ldquo;when all songs are simply collations of
        mistakes put on repeat&rdquo;. or so he used to say, when lit enough to
        convince himself of its wisdom. he wasn&#39;t destined for poetry, as

        which we were not yet in a position to comprehend &ndash; nor indeed

        that had made us what we were. think of it like an outgrown and over
        intellectualised grunge phase, and you&#39;ll get the picture. by the
        time we met, a little into our second year, we were separately hard set

        cradled by a near ascetic dedication to hedonism. we drifted, after
        seminar one day, to the pub, and made a sort of non-verbal pact &ndash;
        our enmities were profuse and vaporous, not yet contained by language.

        we spat only in our own faces. we made a point of attending our seminars
        drunken, and would purposefully extinguish cigarettes on garments which
        risked telegraphing a delicate comportment. we drank a great deal, and
        there was tea, a little at least. it wasn&#39;t so much for us, although
        I did begin to question the nature of our imbibes &ndash; perhaps that
        was the first loosening of the shale. on occasion we would drink with
        company, usually acquaintances, some from university - I began to see a
        troubling resemblance, a unitary appearance. candles trembled and
        rendered tremulous the pinched bridges, ignited the eye glasses of one
        figure, over and over - I was surrounded by simulacra. they were all the
        same. and they all thought the same, in the midst of the drink, and
        although their faces championed the individual contingencies of blots
        and mottles, the severity of nostrils and the hygiene of teeth, there
        was one common denominator. the drink, and we all satisfied an image of
        each (the) other. too hung up on our hang ups with looking, acting a
        certain way, not truly being with one another &ndash; and whatever those
        beings were, they existed in movie posters, television shows...rye on
        the rocks and Marlowe with a forlorn gimlet. and you know, I rather
        preferred tea, and I wondered why I didn&#39;t take more of it, when
        drink seemed only to subdue my senses and terminate my native
        diffidence. it began to occur to me that the social context of the
        imbibe was as important as one&#39;s taste to it. in this way we become
        subdivided (those who drink, tea smokers, acid heads etc.)&ndash; and
        the behaviours we come to associate with a given intoxicant serve to
        streamline individuals into a prefabricated social milieu. take you, for

        others to distinguish it, to delimit its boundaries. without his critic,
        an artist is just a shit slinging simian, like any other goy. critics

        simply the presence of a gesture or a word which appeared to lack all
        self-awareness, yet was not sacrificed to vulgarity, and hence attained
        a sort of beauty. when lean and pretty housewives bought vodka at a
        minute after ten, when children pawed their father&#39;s face while he
        read, unperturbed, on the rail &ndash; all of these things we perceived

        lacked self-awareness only insofar as they were candid. they hadn&#39;t
        yet seen us, we were peeping toms in clear day, and we could endow these
        stolen images with whatever characteristics we liked. that is the
        definition of social cowardice. and so we wandered, with images of blue

        dead set on the musician gig, and he made what folks would call
        background music (jazz, very much in parenthesis) and I would defend it
        often by saying that a woman&#39;s face it lit by a good background, and

        is generally disposed to the belief that relating with others is a bad

        forces him to re-evaluate this position. he will defer this happenstance

        in danger (that same old story, age old fantasy of the heterosexual
        male) and saw only a life of shame for having failed to protect it, or a
        life in stocks for having succeeded. pray for a swift death, he&#39;d

        lean, trim, unsubstantial &ndash; it was simply an image, a cinematic
        kind of image. when we flung that image into the future, we staked a
        claim on land which didn&#39;t yet exist &ndash; but that exaltation, of
        having something to yourself, something which is yours, your own
        property... I understand, a little, of what he meant now.
        &ldquo;something to live in....or...,&rdquo; as an idea is yours.
        that&#39;s what it was. it wasn&#39;t property in the sense that we
        claimed ownership, but merely in the sense that it was entirely
        exclusive, a virtual thing. we</span

        grounds. my thoughts rose from this arid lowland like obelisks, lone
        figures&ndash; that was my time. shouldn&#39;t I, then, have been
        reading things which were relevant to my life? to the lives of people
        whom I lived it with? we would like very much to say that it is a matter

        without having proofs. to pretend one&#39;s life bore resemblance to
        that of the honoured dead. it is easier to compare oneself to something
        beautiful, rather than to craft beauty out of oneself.

        want the feelings that produce it &ndash; because only a limited
        proportion of us can harness it without getting so low, dear, so low as
        to dispense with the glow of ignorance. I was drawing up aesthetics, I

        cinedrome, dig? he and young devotchka, running randy through night
        streets of sodom, etcetera. Jools, with his now absence of musicality,
        with his stutters, and his drunken lumpen act, was trying to lay some
        particularly bad jazz on the collective. he was pushing the third. the
        outside. the man on the other side of the glass. some choice cuts,

        mind of the Zen master &ndash; but he has reached it through
        over-contemplation of himself, without accepting the existence of, well,
        everything and everyone around him. he is mindful, but only of his own

        locked, work pumps, black slacks and chewing gum. an apple ripens in the

        this particular night, we walked past the graveyard, which was always
        there, right around the mid-point, a scorched, prescient seat of some
        unfathomable authority, positioned amongst confused arguments and leers,

        without my noticing at first. I looked back for him, he&#39;d tailed off
        mid riff. I walked over to him, as he ambled on to the gate, and tested
        the chain, and by the time I was at his side he had his head up to the
        spokes, as if he&#39;d seen something. a particular face. the darkness
        from it had something peculiar, it was almost viscous, material, and
        seemed somehow to bleed from out the gate, to be staunched by the

        of gravity&#39;s withdrawal &ndash; and from that moment on, we slowly
        began to drift from one another. he&#39;d turned from the gate, and

        like to take the man in arms and lead him (he senses circumstances in
        which he did the very same, for someone, or some other living thing, a
        kind of fever dream whose imminence is like a past on the cusp of
        remembrance, affecting ones feeling, but not one&#39;s rational
        thoughts). but yet he doesn&#39;t, and watches for a time, as the tannoy
        announces the stop and the sliding doors open with a sanitised,
        mechanical throat-clearing sound. this urge to lead reminds him of the
        father&#39;s arms and how they steadied the child on his shoulders, and
        Jools steps in line as the old man walks the aisle ahead of him. the
        gent grows unsteady, the little bottle of beer chinks against a small
        jar of something in the bag, and in the warmth of that sound and the
        back of the old man&#39;s jacket lingers all Jools&#39; torments. the
        old man wavers, and Jools places a hand upon the gent&#39;s shoulder.
        hardly steady himself. the old man turns, not quite round to contact the
        eyes, but enough to show an appreciative profile, and nod slightly.
        there is a kind grace in the way he smiles, with something very like
        visible foreknowledge, and he sez, &ldquo;we&#39;ll hold each other up
        eh lad&rdquo;, as Jools havers under the breath, very slightly, and
        eddies and regains his coordinates. he sidles round the gent with</span

        the doors close behind, the sonic tear of the football youth&#39;s rasp
        bellows for the last, and is absorbed by the shock proof glass. Jools
        stands without thoughts, or analysis. his ratiocination, slurred, the
        way his nostrils flare, unconscious, all without a voice or instrument.
        he hears a cacophony of febrile drums, a savage self involved thing,
        echoing (somehow forever) between the whitewash walls of the station,
        watching the old man walk slowly away, and up the stairs with the bottle
        and the golden band, the tap of his cane growing fainter as does the
        savour of sweet port. Jools stands alone on the empty platform in
        glorious silence. he has made contact with an idea.

        they&#39;d been perfectly superimposed, one upon the other, and now the
        image he had given to himself to chase tore from him completely, in my

        existence. he felt the world was a master to be toppled, and resented
        his existence as a result &ndash; having retreated into a growing
        monomania, which related with growing prominence to a self image, a
        fostered ideal, the world and all about was delimited by his experience.

        contact with other people. sure, he talked them down, drunk, and he
        vogued, and looked mite pretty and such &ndash; but these were
        materials, illusions. his world restricted rapidly, and more and more,
        the waning goodness revealed so pathetically in his written work grew
        more elusive. he was as a frightened yet prideful child after reading a
        bedtime penny dreadful, hunched up in his bed and watching his mother
        close the door behind her. the room is black, its sole illumination
        (caressing the outlines of childish forms, disused novelties and
        crumpled clothes) spouts from the hallway. and as the door closes slow,
        the light which embeds each of these forms in reassuring stability
        retreats, racing over worn fabrics and cold plastics, the textures of
        infantile existence &ndash; until, with the soft metallic kiss of the
        lock hitting home in the frame, all is without form and in the dark, and
