        someone said to get moving, that the weather was beginning to curdle,
        that the hour was approaching. beads of anxious sweat began to percolate
        under Time's arm-pit; it occurred to me it had been a while since I'd

        the day was limpid, sunless and limp dick, and when the sun broke, it
        did so like a well timed joke, and still the grey remained, like a
        ground to its figure.- see through it like pond scum. jaundiced and
        taught under the ceremonial sheets. it was the grey of hangovers, of
        clocking on, the grey which accompanies the breaking of bad news like
        good china in the front room. it was the grey which announces the day
        but relinquishes the promise of night - the events of day hidden from
        the sun. it was the barbarity of things which must be and always will,
        laws which slide through bone like pistons, and abolish thought. it was
        a grey for looking into the cross-section of a breathing machine, and
        asking questions.

        the streets were empty. now and again a dog with no owner would emerge
        from an alley, cut diagonally by sunlight. it would look up and down the
        intersection and disappear once again into the shade. it was an unkind
        warmth that took more than it gave that beat me down that day, and the
        low dying light cut ribbons of light across the streets. concrete turned
        to green turned into sand, I sank a little more into the earth with each
        grade. now the sun was ripening into the creme of time bleached and
        peeling wallpaper, but the sand was still hot under me. I took off my
        shoes. there was no one else around, but I wondered what I'd say to one
        if one lay down beside me in the sand. by this time, I hadn't spoken to
        another human being in around three months, and yet even the most
        complex and depraved of intimacies would have seemed natural. life's
        playing field had been levelled, and even the subs on the bench were
        walking the pitch with whistles. when time is done and the buildings
        fall, the exclusionary logics fall with them. if I'd have seen someone
        I'd have sooner thought them myself than someone else - that's how long
        it's been. no uniforms, no markings. I would have welcomed another to
        myself like a necessary limb. I looked up and down the beach, and there
        was no one. and sitting down on the dry, as the tide rose, and the sky
        closed the sun, and the pathetic fallacies of better poets began to lour
        like a scowling, matronly face up above, I placed my hand down in the
        sand, and found the death conch spiral, and placed it to my perverted
        ear.

        it was a justifiable point of consternation.<br />
        some of us didn't much like the idea of being beheaded.<br />

        sitting, alone, smoking, thinking, in my private car,<br />
        the wheels would eat up the tracks and time would stop<br />
        because I was not moving with it<br />
        I was simply riding it.<br />
        all the while you sit inside of thoughts of what you are,<br />
        you are still, objectively, someone<br />
        who can only change<br />
        if thoughts are committed to action.<br />

        but when I became motive upon time and moved with it. I realised that to
        become means to die<br />
        and to always be dying<br />
        and somehow that shocked me to lucidity.<br />
        because a little part of me<br />
        the deathly part<br />
        had wished to live forever<br />
        (that is what it means to live forever, to be already dead, as to be
        truly alive is to challenge death knowing that one will lose)<br />
        I wished to live forever<br />
        and when I chose death and gambled my life and become alive in so
        doing,<br />
        I burnt the moorings to what I supposed I was, and, through doing,
        became at once what I am and must be.<br />
        I was stricken, not with the bellicose, erratic maudlin sobbing of a
        drunk<br />
        but with a sober, dry eyed melancholy.<br />
        I saw truly<br />
        and,<br />
        truly, now<br />
        that I would die,<br />
        and there was no longer talking about it or fooling about it<br />
        I realised it, fully, in all of its dimensions.<br />
        I had been trying, in bad faith, to attain this realisation for a long,
        long time,<br />
        I had been going about it entirely the wrong way.<br />
        I thought it was something of value,<br />
        insofar as it was an eternal truth,<br />
        and valued it because, in my bad faith<br />
        I valued only what was eternal,<br />
        and outside the laws of life and death<br />
        as if contemplating the laws of life and death precisely<br />
        would render me exempt from them.<br />
        now I realise that value is only conferred upon mortal things<br />
        and that mortal matters are the only true matters.<br />
        I knew this<br />
        completely<br />
        as I stood with you on the waters of a nothing place,<br />
        the nothing time after one clocks out or there is a drink to be had<br />
        it is always in these interstitial spaces, in which nothingness
        intersects with endlessness<br />
        and these two merge in the commonplace tragedy of the renewal which
        deceives,<br />
        the mirror one perceives in smoke; nostalgia.<br />
        time which smothers itself in the dime store scent of its own perpetual
        death<br />
        fading on old sheets.<br />
      </p>
      <p class="block27db main-text standard-margin">
        that is to say nothing of the only true fact,<br />
        that as your life flowed in mine I felt a love which words do less than
        honour<br />
        they shame it<br />
        and so a word<br />
        if it is judicious,<br />
        is only a grasping doomed to fail<br />
        is only a grasping at precious metals in the dark<br />
        which greed greases and dooms the hold<br />
        and so a word must acknowledge at all stages its death<br />
        as I did when death, love, and the quiet mercy of silent company<br />
        rebounded through the hills which have ensnared me<br />
        and which no work of man<br />
        or totem to industry<br />
        which no pylon can rob me of<br />
        the grand destroying majestic<br />
        the shuddering loneliness<br />
        of being known by others truly<br />
        and truly knowing them.<br />
        then all masks fall and words fail<br />
        and once again<br />
        there is only ever flesh<br />
        attempting to justify flesh<br />
        through unfleshly graspings<br />
        and the petty casting of semantics<br />
        when no lines<br />
        (not even the best lines)<br />
        will catch<br />
        and no words will do.<br />

        by then<br />

        like a scallop shell.<br />
        she pressed it once again to her breast and<br />
        scrubbed the bone like a precious tea-cup of the world's dirt and<br />
        the eye remained open<br />
        not like the eyes of a man<br />
        which, when they close<br />
        close for all time<br />
        the eye remained open<br />
        caught in the headlamps<br />
        of the inscrutable infinity<br />
        which by turns dispenses<br />
        music<br />
        and the grace of things which step lightly on fragile things.

        is it such a shame we come apart like frays in a tapestry<br />
        if, though apart<br />
        we were once a part of the same image?<br />
        we each keep a thread stuck to us and can't shake it off.<br />
        when we die<br />
        separate or otherwise<br />
        we'll take it with us into the air<br />

        an image in which we met<br />
        knew one another<br />
        and from which we both parted<br />
        but parted each with a piece of the other.

        I want to write the book<br />
        that no one reads but everyone's heard of.<br />
        you will place it on your coffee table,<br />
        stain it with red wine<br />
        it will dry out on your radiator.<br />
        you will forget it when you move<br />
        and the new tenants will say they've always meant to get round to it.<br />
        my life drained into the chalice of a tennants glass<br />
        and spilt upon the page.<br />
        but even that fails to approach the problem of physical publishing's
        growing obsolescence<br />
        and so<br />
        by that time<br />
        with the forests levelled<br />
        books might very well have been requisitioned as firewood.<br />
        in which case there will be one of three blogs<br />
        with a paucity of posts<br />
        full of grandiose propositions regarding the utopian future that<br />
        I missed but<br />
        which you'll inhabit<br />
        to say nothing of the OnlyFans<br />
        which in truth was more of a postmodern experiment deconstructing the
        narcissism of modern masculinity<br />
        and shouldn't pose a blemish upon my eminent, and largely disregarded
        literary career.
