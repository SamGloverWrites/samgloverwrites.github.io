        <br /><br /><br />It was said even Charlie, Dan, and the rest of them
        fell prey to the black and blues So and so had gone up north, <br />and
        no one could get a hold of grass, though there was coke in every public
        bathroom from Glasgow to Shetland. <br />No one had the time for even
        coffee or for a half of whatever, any longer. <br />A certain thickening
        of the blood and of the air was observed as light bent out of shape, it
        did not seem to move as it was once want to, some years ago.<br />That
        who-did-you-know got concrete feet, and when I wished upon a teevee
        satellite some evening, a quarter to witching hour, I was answered the
        following morning by a jovial JML presenter, who, propped upon my
        television stand, announced candidly it might never happen, but when it
        did, it would happen sort of sideways, and I wouldn't know the
        difference anyway. <br />
      </p>
      <p class="block2bb italics main-text standard-margin">
        There were whisperings and malingerings around known locations, much
        like whispers while the walls crawl. And when they quit the crawling,
        they slowed to a stop, rolled into the by-lane and the engine cut, then
        nothing but red glare of hazards in the middle of the night. <br />
      </p>
      <p class="block3bb italics main-text standard-margin">
        There were no places called home any longer, for anyone, and we all sort
        of slid by one another and tipped our caps. And goddamn you if you
        didn't know the handshake because we know now, you were never one of us.
        Our legs got stripped of all fat and nothing but sinew, nothing but
        muscle on us, and a thin coat for the winter, because we were all on our
        minimum wage feet, all the time. And you could say nothing to us which
        could offend. <br />And you could do nothing to us that would hurt.
        <br />And there was very little to account for in the bank. <br />And
        sometimes you would turn around and look to find another week or month
        had passed by too quick to see, you'd been living so fast, so fast you
        were living a second at a time, splitting moments into their constituent
        parts like atoms. <br />
      </p>
      <p class="block4bb italics main-text standard-margin">
        Well, <br />it was around the time all this was happening that some guy
        figured he'd talk about himself for a minute. To say we were friends
        would say too much or too little, but we dug each-other's minds in the
        strange way you sometimes happen to do. We'd known each-other by face -
        though not name - when, one chill November afternoon, I found him passed
        out in a bar stool with a notebook in his<br />hand. My attempts to make
        meaningful contact went unnoticed, as he was frightfully pissed. We
        hadn't seen each-other in some years though, and I was interested in
        where he'd been; the murder squads had wiped out most of the
        undesirables and the creatives some years ago. Not that I need to remind
        you, but we inhabit more enlightened times now, don't we?
      </p>
      <p class="block5bb italics main-text standard-margin">
        In any case, with the possibility for conversation minimal, I took the
        notebook from his hands and read what he had to say. While I didn't find
        much in particular you might call likeable, it resonated with me the way
        certain sounds do, like a far-off train. I was still sitting next to
        him, reading, when he awoke some hours later, the bar festooned with
        empty schooners, and myself rather the worse for wear. After he had
        hurriedly reclaimed the standard-margin, he and I traded battle scars
        and raps, and we continued to meet on irregular occasions throughout the
        remaining years of his life. The conversations we had, though I never
        truly appreciated them at the time, rank amongst the most intriguing
        I've enjoyed in the quiet years since my retreat from the scene. <br />
      </p>
      <p class="block6bb italics main-text standard-margin">
        Despite the candour we enjoyed in these meetings, one subject we never
        discussed was the notebook I'd read that day in the bar. I suppose much
        of it expounded on experiences too particular to him to be of much
        interest to anyone else. Despite the literary ambitions of his younger,
        less inebriated years, I think that by the time of writing, writing
        itself had become for him more of an evacuation, and an emptiness, than
        a means of communication. That said, there was always something in
        him<br />which seemed to spite this, a voice that wanted thrown in with
        other people's, and this trace element, I expect, is what resonated
        within me all those years ago. A sort of ghost in the shell.
      </p>
      <p class="block7bb italics main-text standard-margin">
        The manuscript to which I refer, and which I here preface, bore more
        resemblance to an extended face-book post than a work of literary
        significance (or otherwise). Regardless, I couldn't help but find a
        certain quality in what he said, haggard and dissolute though it may be.
        I suppose that says more about myself and he, the times we lived
        through, than it does about the work itself. But now <br />that he's
        gone wherever people go, and has taken the tonsure one last time, before
        one last walk down that narrow road, I thought I might post his
        narcissistic rag and see if anyone felt the same as I did - as I still
        do - about what he wrote.
      </p>
      <p class="block8bb italics main-text standard-margin">
        Anyway, here he is, in his own words; singing drunk in the shower,
        tripping over skips in the vinyl, whilst, high, the world rolls by, or
        even, yes, perhaps even stops for him - now and again.

        I don't know where I'll sleep tonight. it's october and I haven't washed
        in a week, and september or yesterday seems dead and gone and about
        nearly forgotten. I remember I was supposed to be writing something, but
        I left all my shit in the wrong place, someplace I can't go back to.
        thoughts half formed and thrown up on cocktail napkins, supermarket
        receipts, the backs of hands. perhaps I may fix to go back there and
        collect them. &quot;perhaps&quot; is fast becoming the salient term in
        my vocabulary. it is the fugue in my process of indecision, which weighs
        the options in each hand, somehow forgets what it's doing before a
        choice is made, and instead shits in the kitchen sink. I need somewhere
        to sleep tonight, but I don't know where. hot water and a hand-job, or
        some other superfluous grace note of hospitality to distract me from
        futile humanism. there are cars slashed burning on the black. the nights
        are drawing in, so gather your wits up with your skirts and hope. not
        for something fucking stupid, like world peace or equality; hope for a
        clean pillow slip, a lamp-shade, slippers, for the sound sugar makes as
        it sinks into tea. societies aren't built with ideals, but with bricks
        and glucose.

      <p class="block10bb main-text standard-margin">
        no men on the moon, then, no tomorrows. only singular exhalations of
        smoke into the ether, water vapour cast up by the shower, coiling in a
        sun-beam. singular frames, atoms of material reality. inhabiting these
        images, remaining attentive to the fact that you are always closer to
        now than to later, because &quot;now&quot; is something you can touch.
        you can throw &quot;now&quot; down onto a bed and acquaint yourself with
        it. &quot;later&quot; and &quot;before&quot; are twins that promise
        sacred displays of tribadism and deliver only glances and excuses.

        I ought to have mentioned, but I'm in love. my luck is running thin
        lately. we're sitting on this bus to somewhere and I don't know where
        I'll sleep tonight, and I'm in love. I guess it would be easier if she
        wasn't, but her luck must be fucked as well, so now we're fucked
        together. a friend of mine once said it was advisable to have a sense of
        humour about these things, but seeing how humourless he looked when he
        said it, I considered it irony. I was right, but wasn't acquainted with
        the brand. it's the kind like a guy who ties the knot for his own noose
        sort of a thing. if you find that funny you tend not to laugh out loud
        about it. I guess now I'm in on the joke, rather than just trying to
        explain it, and so I can join that long procession of men (you remember
        that jacques brel song, &quot;next&quot;?) who step up to the trapdoor
        willingly, just to feel a pair of arms around their neck.

        so what then? 2 adults, 1 room? I hear howling wolf on the harp or any
        number of sounds I have not the ethnic lineage to adduce. but I know
        something of the black and blues when we step off the bus (which I wish
        I could call a greyhound, just for the way it sounds) - we step off the
        bus, and stand around while all the rest file off behind us. each and
        every one of them has some-place to be, and we have only a person to be
        with, which is not quite as warm and fuzzy as it sounds. their days are
        pressed and starched and will revolve around a familiar face with
        anxious, twisting hands. they seem to pinch it at the temples, they are
        obsessed with washing in a regular, cyclical motion, always forward;
        they are on clock. we are not. I don't know what we are, really. I know
        we slept together last night, and in the morning we sat on some couch in
        a series of couches (stuffing leaking from bullet-holes, torn leather,
        wayward springs protruding like broken ribs) smoking cigarettes and
        drinking coffee, watching time half consciously piss itself away with
        half shut eyes.

        there's something else I haven't really mentioned, which is that I'm a
        writer, or at least supposed to be. that means I'm meant to take moments
        of instability and chaos and extract from them, like uncooperative
        teeth, such things as structure, meaning, or the wilting emotions a
        broadsheet journalist might call &quot;perennial&quot; between sips of a
        macchiato. people read blurbs like the back of wine bottles, and the
        true sentiments of intention float to the bottom of the glass like
        sediment, and<br />are forgotten. I'd like to mention here, as it's sort
        of relevant, that I don't really read, I don't do much writing. and that
        in all those moments when we lay together staring up at the smoke from
        our fags, I felt nothing at all, because for us it was an evacuation and
        an emptiness. I invite the valentines pedlars to fuck themselves, and
        buy their right hand an apologetic bouquet afterwards if they think
        that's what it is. I know what it is. that's why I don't talk about it,
        I keep schtum. like now, for instance.

        she hands me a cigarette because I haven't spoken in a while and I've
        been staring at someone's shoes. she thinks I'm being pensive, or
        sullen, but in actual fact, the shoes are quite atrocious, and I'm
        waiting for the person responsible to turn around so I can put an insult
        to a face. I explain this. she agrees without equivocation. there, now
        you can feel more comfortable sharing my general sense of disdain,
        seeing as it's not just me you're agreeing with. <br />

        she has to go do some shit with her hair, she says. I don't know for
        who, she won't tell me. I imagine a rich old bachelor who will pay
        page-boys to defile her in the billiard room, but don't mention this
        aloud, so as to preserve the composure of any nearby feminists. <br />

      <p class="block16bb main-text standard-margin">anyhow,</p>
      <p class="block17bb main-text standard-margin">
        it is that she needs some money for the hair, or whatever, so we go find
        an ATM. I figure I'll go see a film about how the world will end, to
        distract me from how the world is ending, and determine to extract cash
        in the pursuit of this aesthetic enterprise. <br />

        we're in the city now, we've made it. I'm fairly sure she's got around a

      <p class="block19bb main-text standard-margin">
        while we walk, I talk to her about things, because I like the way she

        &quot;consider how few people can quote milton, and how many know the
        lyrics to &quot;china in your hand.&quot;&quot; <br />&quot;so you want
        to be the cindy lauper of poetry.&quot;<br />&quot;why not?&quot<br />&quot;aye

        a song totally about his dick. and it's fire. I love that shit.&quot;
        <br />&quot;well maybe you should start writing poems about your dick
        then?&quot; <br />&quot;that wouldn't give me much to write about. I'll
        stick to myopic technophobia and a preoccupation with drug fuelled
        counter culture.&quot; <br />&quot;you can stop using my phone to play

        and so on. her hair is blue and when she pouts, buildings in the street
        lean over to ask what the matter is. all I have to give her are words
        and, well, she's still here, for now. I just keep my eyes above the neck
        and try not to look at the warning signs on cigarette packets. I try not
        to read too much, or read into too much, too much at all, if that makes
        sense. I haven't done this in a while, you know. this used to be my
        evacuation and my emptiness, and that worked fine for a while, I
        suppose. but then I guess I got tired of talking to myself and wandered
        out into people to see if they had anything to say. turns out,
        unsurprisingly, that they did, so that's what I've been doing with
        myself lately.<br />yet still, when people ask what I am - and though
        the answer is often bored and listless - I'll forgo the truth
        (frequently inebriated bar-tend) in favour of the more exotic
        alternative, &quot;writer,&quot; which has more to do with a future I
        haven't yet engraved in time, so much as sketched with crayons. in any
        case - &quot;writer?&quot;. writer, as token of a type, as distinguished
        from other people who write, besides the fact most everyone does,
        everyday. most aesthetically, through speech - but then their writing is
        a shadow of their speech, and their voice the dial that casts it. they
        scatter their writing to the wind. people who make it their job want the
        wind to stop for them, because they're so damn important.

        dinner table. not a <em>writer, </em>the least literary of all figures.

        writers essentialise, they want to reduce things to the naked element.
        ideally, they should save us from our solipsism and bring us back to
        other people. but sometimes it gets a bit fucking annoying being
        reminded that most of your thoughts are second hand, and that the ones
        which aren't probably aren't very good. anyway, I think they fall short
        of the truth on purpose, these writers, because they're scared that,
        after all is said, there'll be nothing left to say anymore, and no room
        for them. if they got too close to what it is, the truth might prove
        we're not truly here on purpose, that the words we speak are a
        distraction from the improbability of creation's intentionality. so we
        create ourselves,<br />and try to make god an image we can make

        epicentre of tomorrow's headline. she's always gone before they can take
        a statement, and all that remains is her face peering from the top left
        balcony, in the back of the picture, watching it all. not that she'd
        tell you any of this. once we wanted to be famous. now that it's so
        easy, we seem content to ironise it, and so the generation which
        idolised idolatry prefers to be adjacent to what's happening, rather
        than a part of it. remaining outside is now an inside joke.I check my

        think of lonely old maids in castle keeps staring off into reveries of

        feel envious. they could at least pretend their letters hadn't been

        it began on halloween. I know, because there was a bloody hole in my
        chest where something important used to be. that, and all the
        decorations. I recall waiting for her in the attic room of the bar,
        before it started, and knowing even then I was about to commit to an
        inadvisable union. there was some song on in the background, something
        with strings which reminded me of bernard herrman, and as time bulged
        like wet floorboards in the anticipation of it all, there was only every
        man who'd ever waited for a woman, woman for man, there was only and
        always the abeyance as you look up and see the guillotine suspended
        above, waiting to descend. and there were all the things we say to slow
        or speed this anticipation, all the games we play. every man and every
        woman in a procession, waiting for the blade. some of them holding hands
        along the way. then she arrived, and all of these thoughts descended
        upon her head and coloured her with subtext, like a sound that changes
        through a law of association. you worry that, after this descent, the
        person that they are is erased in favour of who you think they are, or
        need them to be. I've found this to apply to more things than just the
        games which men and women play when they're alone. it's the beholder
        that's proven shallow in this, not the beheld. but in spite of all the
        mess, you seem to see hidden things you didn't notice before, after. at
        once, all the shite pop music I considered trite seemed imbued with
        hidden significance, like wise old men who once seemed drunk, but now
        seem to see things at the bottom of lake beds that young ones don't.

        things. this was before the klaxons and all the rest with which we are
        now so acutely familiar.<br />I would get up and do my exercise, shave.
        I would even brew coffee and stand at the window with a quietly
        contemplative look on my face. none of it did much good and I couldn't
        shake the feeling the world was about to end and I was the last to find
        out about it. she would hand me things and I would drink or smoke them.
        when I walked down the street my feet sank through the concrete and I
        walked in flames. you mightn't have noticed this, in between my
        cigarette, my polished boots, and all my petty justifications and
        appearances. we hid it from the bosses and the murder squads, and made
        out alright. we rarely value our own time until we've agreed to let
        other people waste 50 hours of it a week, but I didn't question this -
        at the time. for although I could tie my tie and play the petty games of
        movers, none of it could distract me from the fact that I had beaten
        myself both black and blue and all the world I saw was a bruise. but in

        I slept on a bed of nails and stuck pins through various extremities.
        wrapped myself in sheets of drywall and asbestos, consumed water which
        ran black from the tap. I ate dirt and retched and ate some more, and
        looked at a few photographs because there was nothing else I could think
        of, and remarkably, found this to be the worst. I buried myself upside
        down and had john wayne exhume me just to shoot my eyes out. I threw
        myself against walls and out of windows without notice, I jumped off
        bridges with typewriters tied to my feet and sank to the bottom. myself
        and all the other cunts who'd royally fucked it formed an orderly line
        to hell, because it was the best place to get a drink at that time and,
        blessedly, nick cave was on the juke. I woke up in a pool of my own
        blood, filled a wine glass and painted the town with it. me and my
        sisters made molotovs and firebombed polling stations (don't worry, they
        were empty.) I plotted seditions, overthrew governments, destroyed local
        businesses. I watched the perverse, the incestuous, and the unworthy
        crawl from the base of burning buildings, with a lighter in my hand and
        a can of gasoline at my feet, while their old ladies pawed my shoulder
        and told me how pretty I looked, in that light. I looked into the eyes
        of strangers and didn't find much there, so I repeated what I'd done so
        far, added some broken glass and barbed wire and other caustic
        materials, drank burning acid, burnt off my fingertips with bunsen
        burners. I engaged in acts of chimerical alchemy, I turned my piss into
        wine and my shit into gold, and burnt my formulas so no one would know
        how. I screamed it was alive, and once it was, I killed it, and had a
        fag, because I knew how that story ended and I wasn't so naive as I had
        been. when it was over, and I was empty, tired, and heartbroken in a
        barbour jacket - well, I was alright mate, to be honest. I looked pretty

        want my voice to be heard, and so I must throw it in with other

        coming if I'd been looking at it. but of course the streets are on fire,

        never know if it's something you said or something you didn't say, but
        you know when the silence comes it's done. I no longer have the right to
        say through silence what I'd like to with words - besides which, I have

        she asked me once why I bothered writing, when all I did was complain
        how little people read books. instead of saying something smart, like
        how people kept burning them, I let the question remain unanswered. I
        still haven&rsquo;t answered it, but when shit like this happens, when
        I'm walking to a firing squad, or marching someone else to theirs, I get
        the itch to write it all down. I ask myself again.

      <p class="block135bb main-text standard-margin">
        writers are supposed to say things universally agreed upon, but agreed
        upon silently. they sort of spoil the joke of life to seem smart at
        parties. I've never felt terribly smart at parties. and I guess that
        I've never felt much like a writer. furthermore, in spite of this sacred
        duty to common denominators, I've always felt unable to marry myself to
        these things we are meant, as world citizens, to deem important. I
        suppose it's kind of funny how that feeling should be felt by so many.
        they might read something, like this perhaps, and feel not quite so
        alone or helpless, they might pass me, alone and helpless, on the
        street. neither of us would know, and we'd still feel alone and
        helpless, separately. that's the cold fact; that we hold up our ideas of
        how we might feel to escape how we do feel, and always will.

        forget the piquancy of each moment with her. they'll be smoothed over
        and rewritten by memory. and even now, knowing this, doesn't change a
        thing. I am wilfully deceiving myself. <br />I guess what I'm trying to
        say is that writers are liars. <br />whether they drink too much or fuck
        around, well, those things are questions of aesthetics. anytime someone
        thinks an empty epigram is important enough to be written down - they're
        lying. and furthermore, they're only writing because they're alone and
        there's nothing to wrap their dick around. pardon my being course, but
        it is what it is. <br />why do you think I'm writing this down now,

        supposedly a writer should be honest. but some of the worst things
        you've ever heard were the most honest, and recited in the most

        make a career breaking bad news to people, unless you sort of enjoyed

        I can only hope that my sufferings do not become so particular I can no
        longer speak of them with other people. suffering is only particular to
        the suffering, however. it's a sort of law which binds us all together,
        and the anticipation of it, and preparation for its diminution, is a
        shared responsibility. we have all been on the bottom. we all know what
        it is to feel the whip. we are none of us the same, <br />but we are all
        of us equally susceptible to circumstance, to contingency, to the whip.

        caring of one another. I'm thinking of these things without speaking as
        she walks away and I follow behind her. if I am uncaring, I am at least
        a careful student of ironies.

        mistakes like these are a young man's luxury. I look at old men and the
        way they sit in chairs and keep their voices to themselves, without
        moving. for a while I didn't understand their indolence, and now I know
        that whenever a man moves, or fixes to make one, trouble is on its way.
        trouble often carries something sharp, long, and heavy, and is not
        acquainted with prophylactics. despite this, I want to make a move, or
        say something, even if it's a second hand armchair idea that no one much
        cares for.
