        <p>
          I've got a bunch of writing which has almost exclusively occupied the
          e-mail inboxes of my closest associates. While they are a dedicated
          readership, they are rather an exclusive one. Thus, in the interests
          of sending the good word a little farther afield, I'm firing
          everything on to this website.<br /><br />
        </p>
        <p>
          If you've happened upon this page, it's probably because I've accosted
          you in a pub and written down the URL (some have business cards, where
          I have cocktail napkins). My most sincere and retroactive apologies.
          However, if you've gone so far as to start reading, I must have been
          at least moderately charming. The chances are that you caught me in
          between drinks one and two. That's when I'm at my best. Linked
          conveniently above are some examples of my work. Some of it, I must be
          honest, was written between drinks three and four - but most of it
          occured in the sweet spot, where from the right angle, the street
          through the smoke dripping venetians looks a little less like a
          horror, and a little more like something worth sweeping.<br /><br />

          <!-- Maybe formatting is
      fixed? -->
          As a disclaimer, the formatting of each text looks perfect on a
          desktop at present, but if you're reading on a mobile phone it will
          more closely resemble my wildest nightmares, which revolve entirely
          around improper line breaks.<br /><br />
        </p>
        <p>Peace be upon you, and have a lucky day xoxo</p>
