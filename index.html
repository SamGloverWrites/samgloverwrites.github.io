      <p>
        I've got a bunch of writing which has almost exclusively occupied the
        e-mail inboxes of my closest associates. While they are a dedicated
        readership, they are rather an exclusive one. Thus, in the interests of
        sending the good word a little farther afield, I'm firing everything on
        to this website.<br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        If you've happened upon this page, it's probably because I've accosted
        you in a pub and written down the URL (some have business cards, where I
        have cocktail napkins). My most sincere and retroactive apologies.
        However, if you've gone so far as to start reading, I must have been at
        least moderately charming. The chances are that you caught me in between
        drinks one and two. That's when I'm at my best. Linked conveniently
        above are some examples of my work. Some of it, I must be honest, was
        written between drinks three and four - but most of it occured in the
        sweet spot, where from the right angle, the street through the smoke
        dripping venetians looks a little less like a horror, and a little more
        like something worth sweeping.<br /><br />

        <!-- Maybe formatting is
      fixed? -->
        As a disclaimer, the formatting of each text looks perfect on a desktop
        at present, but if you're reading on a mobile phone it will more closely
        resemble my wildest nightmares, which revolve entirely around improper
        line breaks.<br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>Peace be upon you, and have a lucky day xoxo</p>
