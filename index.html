      <p>
        I've got a bunch of writing which has almost exclusively occupied the e-mail inboxes of my closest associates.
        While they are a dedicated readership, they are rather an exclusive one. Thus, in the interests of sending the good word a little farther afield,
        I'm firing everything on to this website.</br></br>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you've happened upon this page, it's probably because I've accosted you in a pub and written down the URL
        (some have business cards, where I have cocktail napkins). My most sincere and retroactive apologies. However, if you've gone so far as to start reading,
        I must have been at least moderately charming. The chances are that you caught me in between drinks one and two.
        That's when I'm at my best. Linked conveniently above are some examples of my work.
        Some of it, I must be honest, was written between drinks three and four - but most of it occured in the sweet spot, where from the right angle,
        the street through the smoke dripping venetians looks a little less like a horror, and a little more like something worth sweeping.</br></br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <!-- Maybe formatting is fixed? -->
        As a disclaimer, the formatting of each text looks perfect on a desktop at present,
        but if you're reading on a mobile phone it will more closely resemble my wildest nightmares, which revolve entirely around improper line breaks.</br></br>
      </p>
      <p>Peace be upon you, and have a lucky day xoxo</p>
